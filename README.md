A software to minimize the chaos generated at the time of natural disaster such as floods, tsunami, earthquake and many more.
The software will include details of the people present in the affected areas. 
These details can be taken when a person downloads an appliacation on his/her mobile phone or through online registration if a person does not possess a smartphone.
These registrations can be done like registrations were done for the AADHAR CARD.
Data of the individual will contain his/her name, a permanent address, present address, a distress address (in case of emergency), maximum number of mobile numbers the user may want to give, e-mail ID and the user's AADHAR NUMBER (if present).
The server automatically updates the loction once disaster warning is given by the meteorological Department and continues to update it every 5-10 minutes during the whole duration of the disaster.
At other times (when the place is not in range of a natural disaster) the sever does not track the user's location, and thus the user's privacy is also maintained.
It can warn people about the level of danger they can face, depending on their location and also will inform them about the actions taken by the goverment,safe zones,safety precautions etc.
The safe zones will be the areas already fixed by the government where people will assemble during the time of the disaster and rescue operations will be carried out soon after. Those safe zones will have all the basic necessities soon after the warning.
For smartphone users, the appliction on the mobile will immidiately provide directions to the nearest safe zone in the city/town/village and will continuously update the users on the disaster situation.
For non-smartphone users, a text message will be sent in English, Hindi and in a local language of that area describing the disaster situation and directions to the nearest safe zone will be given.
If the user remains in the original location for a very long time, a call will be made, asking him/her to move to the safe zone.
Even if a few people read warnings, they can gather others and move to a safe zone.
This will minimize the chaos-which is usually created when a disaster warning is given-as in this case, people know where they need to move to remain safe and the directions to that place.
The number of people reaching a particular safe zone will be continuously monitored so that the safe zone does not get overloaded.
Once the user reaches the safe zone, he/she will be constantly updated regarding the supplies situation, the disaster situation and rescue operations being carried out.
The supply of food and aids will be prioritized according to number of people in a particular safe zone and the rate of influx of people into the safe zone.
As the disaster stars to end, the software would start notifying the people who can leave the safe zone and go back to their present address and/or permanent address and/or distress address, based on which is nearer to the user.
